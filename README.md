# Petroglyph UI Kit
A super-sweet starter UI kit for Petroglyph Creative websites, including our own.

## Installation
`npm install  --save-dev` does pretty much everything. There may be some dependencies that you must install separately.

## Use

#### `npm run dev`
This command will launch a dev server on your local IP address that does not output code, but allows you to see code changes in real time.

#### `npm run build`
This command builds your project code into the /docs/ directory and does not deploy a server.

### About this repo
This is a basic code starter kit that makes use of basic [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Webpack](webpack.js.org). It is a compilation of innumerable web reference pages, outdated tutorials, Google searches, and a UI Kit built for us by Block 81.

Our UI Repo is offered as-is and without warranty or guarantee of support (though we will help if we can.) Please tell us or include credit if something you do with this code goes public.
